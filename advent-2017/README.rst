Advent of Code 2017
===================

These are my solutions to 2017's `Advent of Code`_, written in `Julia`_ because
why not?

Latest Timing Results
---------------------

Because who doesn't like evaluating performance?

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./time.sh
    Day 01.jl: 0.26
    Day 02.jl: 0.68
    Day 03.jl: 0.39
    Day 04.jl: 0.69
    Day 05.jl: 0.78
    Day 06.jl: 0.39
    Day 07.jl: 1.16
    Day 08.jl: 0.73
    Day 09.jl: 0.27
    Day 10.jl: 0.50
    Day 11.jl: 2.91
    Day 12.jl: 0.67
    Day 13.jl: 6.36
    Day 14.jl: 1.21
    Day 15.jl: 122.28

Hmm, I haven't been trying overly hard for speed here, but it's nice to see that
the tagline which attracted me to try Julia (its like Python, but fast!) is
decently accurate.

EDIT: I may have spoke too soon. Clearly I did day 15 wrong.
