Advent of Code 2021
===================

These are my solutions to 2021's `Advent of Code`_, written in `Nim`_ since I
didn't get around to properly finishing in 2018 or 2020! Currently taking bets
on whether the third time is the charm.

Since I'm committing these files in January without all the days completed, my
guess is "no".
